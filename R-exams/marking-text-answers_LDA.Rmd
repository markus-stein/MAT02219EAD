## Text analysis/topic modelling
* Open-ended questions questions are more eficient/complete assessments.
* But are also harder to mark.
    + we want to use here text/topic analyis/minning...
* Text in `R` means a object `string`
    + so we are doing string manipulation
* *Moodle*, R/exams and open-ended questions...


## String manipulation + general pattern analysis + grouping reponses
